# Mendix Platform App
Overview

This project was developed using the Mendix low-code platform during my days @ equinix. The goal of this application was to design and deploy a working business app using visual modeling, workflows, and database entities.

The project demonstrates my understanding of low-code development, application logic, and user experience design within an enterprise platform.
